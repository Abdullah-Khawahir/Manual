How it works:
Right click "Manual-feature_vehicleicons" folder and Open GitBash or Run
Type: npm run rebuildvehicleicons

That will simply print all the formatted code into your console/terminal window.
Currently, we have explicitly decided to NOT write it to the vehicle_icons.html directly,
in case there will be more changes there.

So just copy the output from your terminal and paste it into the vehicle_icons.html, done.

As you can see, there's a couple of UNDEFINEDs that we havent't fixed.
You'll find a var classnames in the scripts/reubuildvehicleicons.js that serves as dictionary: 
Simply add entries for missing types and 'proper' names, then run the script again until all the UNDEFINED entries are gone.
