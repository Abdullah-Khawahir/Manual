## Building and testing
This requires installing Node-JS, npm and getting honkit, a fork of gitbook:  `npm install honkit --save-dev`
 - Install plugins: `npx honkit init`
 - Build: `npx honkit build`
 - Host locally (available on localhost:4000): `npx honkit serve`

If you get errors during building related to the reality-theme plugin execute the following commands before building:
```
cd ./packages/reality-theme
npm link
cd ../..
npm link honkit-plugin-reality-theme
```
